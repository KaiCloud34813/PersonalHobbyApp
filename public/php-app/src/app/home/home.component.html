<h3>
  Welcome to my PHP project, this is my first built from scratch project. I am
  new to coding, and I have never tought that one day this could be possible.
  Try to enjoy my website by registering yourself then by login in to discover
  my collection of books. Everything should be working properly. If you don't
  enjoy it that much, it is okay! You can always check the error page and check
  the "no" on the "return back home" option.
